# Roman Numeral String to Integer Converter
A C++ program that converts a Roman numeral string to an integer. 

The idea for the program comes from D.S. Malik's "Data Structures Using C++, Second Edition" chapter 1 programming exercise 1.  

<hr>
Write a program that converts a number entered in Roman numerals to decimal form. Your program should consist of a class, say romanType. An object of romanType should do the following:

- Store the number as a Roman numeral.
  
 - Convert and store the number into decimal form.
  
  - Print the number as a Roman numeral or decimal number as requested by the user.

  The decimal values of the Roman numerals are:
      
      M 1000
      
      D 500 
  
      C 100 
  
      L 50 
 
      X 10
  
      V 5 
  
      I 1
